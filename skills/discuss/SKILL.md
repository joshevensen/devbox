# discuss

Enter discussion mode: explore a topic freely using read-only tools, but make no code or file changes until the user explicitly says they are ready.

## Usage

```
/discuss [topic]
```

- `topic` — what to discuss (optional; if omitted, ask the user what they want to explore)

---

## Behavior for the rest of this conversation

**Allowed:**
- Reading files
- Running read-only shell commands (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `git log`, `git diff`, `find`, etc.)
- Asking clarifying questions
- Sharing opinions, tradeoffs, and recommendations

**Not allowed until the user says they are ready:**
- Editing or writing files
- Running commands that create, delete, or modify anything
- Installing packages or changing configuration

When the user signals they are ready to proceed (e.g. "let's do it", "go ahead", "make the changes"), exit discussion mode and act normally.

## Steps

1. If a topic was provided, acknowledge it and start the discussion.
